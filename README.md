## WordCount

Program to count the number of particular words in a given text file after cleaning the text for analysis.

The file used for the project is uploaded with the project .

You can uncomment the file_data's & sample's section print command to understand what that variable holds
(As file is too long, therefore didn't print their ouputs along with them).

Instuctions:
1. Download the "98-0.txt" file.
2. Open the WordCount.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Edit the path of the "98-0.txt" file on your system (in the accessing the file section).

You can add the stopwords you dont want/require in the stopword data structure so as to not include it in the word_count.
