      "coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\n",
      "to blackheath. reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\n",

      "falling to pieces at the larger joints. as often as the driver rested\n",
      "them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the\n",
      "near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\n",
      "unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\n",
      "hill. whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\n",
      "nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\n",
      "forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\n",
      "none. a clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\n",
      "air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\n",
      "waves of an unwholesome sea might do. it was dense enough to shut out\n",
      "everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\n",
      "and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\n",
      "into it, as if they had made it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\n",
      "side of the mail. all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\n",
      "ears, and wore jack-boots. not one of the three could have said, from\n",
      "anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\n",
      "hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\n",
      "the eyes of the body, of his two companions. in those days, travellers\n",
      "were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\n",
      "the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. as to the latter,\n",
      "when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n",
      "“the captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\n",
      "non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. so the guard\n",
      "of the dover mail thought to himself, that friday night in november, one\n",
      "thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up shooter’s hill, as\n",
      "he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\n",
      "and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\n",
      "loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\n",
      "deposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n",
      "\n",
      "the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\n",
      "the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\n",
      "all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\n",
      "the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\n",
      "taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the\n",
      "journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“wo-ho!” said the coachman. “so, then! one more pull and you’re at the\n",

      "passengers squashing along by its side. they had stopped when the coach\n",
      "stopped, and they kept close company with it. if any one of the three\n",
      "had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\n",
      "into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\n",
      "getting shot instantly as a highwayman.\n",
      "\n",
      "the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. the horses\n",
      "stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\n",
      "the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“tst! joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\n",

      "“_i_ say a horse at a gallop, tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold\n",
      "of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “gentlemen! in the king’s\n",
      "name, all of you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "with this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\n",
      "the offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "the passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\n",
      "the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. he\n",
      "remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\n",
      "in the road below him. they all looked from the coachman to the guard,\n",
      "and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. the coachman looked\n",
      "back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\n",
      "his ears and looked back, without contradicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\n",
      "of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\n",
      "indeed. the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\n",
      "the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. the hearts of the\n",
      "passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\n",
      "quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\n",
      "the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“so-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “yo there! stand!\n",
      "i shall fire!”\n",
      "\n",
      "the pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\n",

      "advance, and always going on the side which mr. lorry took, as though he\n",
      "dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about\n",
      "here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over\n",
      "his shoulder, took out a key.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“i think it necessary to turn the key.” monsieur defarge whispered it\n",

      "\n",
      "“why?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“why! because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\n",

      "harm--if his door was left open.”\n",
      "\n",

      "are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under\n",
      "that sky there, every day. long live the devil. let us go on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\n",
      "of it had reached the young lady’s ears. but, by this time she trembled\n",
      "under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,\n",
      "and, above all, such dread and terror, that mr. lorry felt it incumbent\n",
      "on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“courage, dear miss! courage! business! the worst will be over in a\n",

      "\n",
      "they went up slowly and softly. the staircase was short, and they were\n",
      "soon at the top. there, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at\n",
      "once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at\n",
      "the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which\n",
      "the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. on hearing\n",
      "footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed\n",
      "themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the\n",
      "wine-shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained monsieur\n",
      "defarge. “leave us, good boys; we have business here.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "there appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of\n",
      "the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, mr.\n",
      "lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:\n",
      "\n",
      "“do you make a show of monsieur manette?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“is that well?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_i_ think it is well.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "with an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in\n",
      "through the crevice in the wall. soon raising his head again, he struck\n",
      "twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to\n",
      "make a noise there. with the same intention, he drew the key across it,\n",
      "three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned\n",
      "it as heavily as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "the door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the\n",
      "room and said something. a faint voice answered something. little more\n",
      "than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "he looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. mr. lorry\n",
      "got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for he\n",
      "felt that she was sinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“a-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not of\n",
      "business shining on his cheek. “come in, come in!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“of it? what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i mean of him. of my father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of\n",
      "their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his\n",
      "shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. he sat her\n",
      "down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,\n",
      "took out the key again, and held it in his hand. all this he did,\n",
      "methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he\n",
      "could make. finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to\n",
      "where the window was. he stopped there, and faced round.\n",
      "\n",
      "the garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim\n",
      "and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the\n",
      "roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from\n",
      "the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any\n",
      "other door of french construction. to exclude the cold, one half of this\n",
      "door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.\n",
      "such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it\n",
      "was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit\n",
      "alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work\n",
      "requiring nicety in such obscurity. yet, work of that kind was being\n",
      "done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face\n",
      "towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at\n",
      "him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very\n",
      "busy, making shoes.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "salutation, as if it were at a distance:\n",
      "\n",
      "“good day!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you are still hard at work, i see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "after a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\n",
      "voice replied, “yes--i am working.” this time, a pair of haggard eyes\n",
      "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\n",
      "\n",
      "the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. it was not the\n",
      "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\n",
      "doubt had their part in it. its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was\n",
      "the faintness of solitude and disuse. it was like the last feeble echo\n",
      "of a sound made long and long ago. so entirely had it lost the life and\n",
      "resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once\n",
      "beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. so sunken and\n",
      "suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. so expressive\n",
      "it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,\n",
      "wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered\n",
      "home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked\n",
      "up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical\n",
      "perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were\n",
      "aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i want,” said defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,\n",
      "“to let in a little more light here. you can bear a little more?”\n",
      "\n",
      "the shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\n",
      "at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the\n",
      "other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“what did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you can bear a little more light?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i must bear it, if you let it in.” (laying the palest shadow of a\n",
      "stress upon the second word.)\n",
      "\n",
      "the opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\n",
      "angle for the time. a broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\n",
      "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his\n",
      "labour. his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his\n",
      "feet and on his bench. he had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very\n",
      "long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. the hollowness and\n",
      "thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet\n",
      "dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really\n",
      "otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.\n",
      "his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body\n",
      "to be withered and worn. he, and his old canvas frock, and his loose\n",
      "stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion\n",
      "from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of\n",
      "parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.\n",
      "\n",
      "he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones\n",
      "of it seemed transparent. so he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,\n",
      "pausing in his work. he never looked at the figure before him, without\n",
      "first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had\n",
      "lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without\n",
      "first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked defarge,\n",

      "\n",
      "but, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. when\n",
      "he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of defarge, the shoemaker\n",
      "looked up. he showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the\n",
      "unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at\n",
      "it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then\n",
      "the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. the\n",
      "look and the action had occupied but an instant.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you have a visitor, you see,” said monsieur defarge.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“come!” said defarge. “here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when\n",
      "he sees one. show him that shoe you are working at. take it, monsieur.”\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. lorry took it in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "“i forget what it was you asked me. what did you say?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s\n",
      "information?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it is a lady’s shoe. it is a young lady’s walking-shoe. it is in the\n",
      "present mode. i never saw the mode. i have had a pattern in my hand.” he\n",
      "glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and the maker’s name?” said defarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\n",
      "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\n",
      "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and\n",
      "so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission. the task of\n",
      "recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he\n",
      "had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or\n",
      "endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a\n",

      "took the shoe up, and resumed his work.\n",
      "\n",

      "raised them, and saw her face. the two spectators started forward,\n",

      "to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag\n",
      "attached to it. he opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained\n",
      "a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden\n",
      "hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“without doubt,” said the polished uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "so long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.\n",
      "when coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,\n",

      "fine mask, opened a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that\n",
      "took me away. it carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is\n",
      "a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have\n",
      "sustained me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”\n",
      "\n",

      "the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight\n",
      "lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a\n",
      "graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good\n",
      "breeding that it was not reassuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything i know, you may have\n",
      "expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious\n",
      "circumstances that surrounded me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“but, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him with\n",
      "deep distrust, “i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,\n",
      "and would know no scruple as to means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“my friend, i told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the\n",

      "\n",
      "“i recall it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“thank you,” said the marquis--very sweetly indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "his tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical\n",
      "instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "“in effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “i believe it to be at once your\n",
      "bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in\n",
      "france here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.\n",
      "“dare i ask you to explain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court, and had not\n",
      "been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would\n",
      "have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “for the honour\n",
      "of the family, i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.\n",
      "pray excuse me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i perceive that, happily for me, the reception of the day before\n",
      "yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with refined\n",
      "politeness; “i would not be sure of that. a good opportunity for\n",
      "consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence\n",
      "your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for\n",
      "yourself. but it is useless to discuss the question. i am, as you say,\n",
      "at a disadvantage. these little instruments of correction, these gentle\n",
      "aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that\n",
      "might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest\n",
      "and importunity. they are sought by so many, and they are granted\n",
      "(comparatively) to so few! it used not to be so, but france in all such\n",
      "things is changed for the worse. our not remote ancestors held the right\n",
      "of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. from this room, many such\n",
      "dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),\n",
      "one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing\n",
      "some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? we have\n",
      "lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the\n",
      "assertion of our station, in these days, might (i do not go so far as\n",
      "to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. all very bad, very\n",
      "bad!”\n",
      "\n",
      "the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;\n",
      "as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still\n",
      "containing himself, that great means of regeneration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“we have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern\n",
      "time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that i believe our name to be\n",
      "more detested than any name in france.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“let us hope so,” said the uncle. “detestation of the high is the\n",
      "involuntary homage of the low.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“there is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face i can\n",
      "look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any\n",
      "deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“a compliment,” said the marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,\n",
      "merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.\n",
      "hah!” and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly\n",
      "crossed his legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "but, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes\n",
      "thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at\n",
      "him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,\n",
      "and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of\n",
      "indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "“repression is the only lasting philosophy. the dark deference of fear\n",
      "and slavery, my friend,” observed the marquis, “will keep the dogs\n",
      "obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts\n",
      "out the sky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "that might not be so long as the marquis supposed. if a picture of the\n",
      "chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as\n",
      "they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to\n",
      "him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from\n",
      "the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. as for the roof\n",
      "he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new\n",
      "way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead\n",
      "was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“meanwhile,” said the marquis, “i will preserve the honour and repose\n",
      "of the family, if you will not. but you must be fatigued. shall we\n",
      "terminate our conference for the night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“a moment more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“an hour, if you please.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits\n",
      "of wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_we_ have done wrong?” repeated the marquis, with an inquiring smile,\n",
      "and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account\n",
      "to both of us, in such different ways. even in my father’s time, we did\n",
      "a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and\n",
      "our pleasure, whatever it was. why need i speak of my father’s time,\n",
      "when it is equally yours? can i separate my father’s twin-brother, joint\n",
      "inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“death has done that!” said the marquis.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is\n",
      "frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to\n",
      "execute the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last\n",
      "look of my dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to\n",
      "redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the marquis, touching him on the\n",
      "breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--“you\n",
      "will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”\n",
      "\n",
      "every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was\n",
      "cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking\n",
      "quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. once again he\n",
      "touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of\n",
      "a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the\n",
      "body, and said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“my friend, i will die, perpetuating the system under which i have\n",
      "lived.”\n",
      "\n",
      "when he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his\n",
      "box in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a small\n",
      "bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. but you are lost,\n",
      "monsieur charles, i see.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“this property and france are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly; “i\n",
      "renounce them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“are they both yours to renounce? france may be, but is the property? it\n",
      "is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i had no intention, in the words i used, to claim it yet. if it passed\n",
      "to me from you, to-morrow--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“which i have the vanity to hope is not probable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--or twenty years hence--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you do me too much honour,” said the marquis; “still, i prefer that\n",
      "supposition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“--i would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. it is little to\n",
      "relinquish. what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“hah!” said the marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“to the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,\n",
      "under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,\n",
      "mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,\n",
      "and suffering.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“hah!” said the marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“if it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better\n",
      "qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the\n",
      "weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave\n",
      "it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in\n",
      "another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. there is a curse\n",
      "on it, and on all this land.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and you?” said the uncle. “forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new\n",
      "philosophy, graciously intend to live?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at\n",
      "their backs, may have to do some day--work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“in england, for example?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes. the family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. the\n",
      "family name can suffer from me in no other, for i bear it in no other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be\n",
      "lighted. it now shone brightly, through the door of communication. the\n",
      "marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his\n",
      "valet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“england is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have\n",
      "prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i have already said, that for my prospering there, i am sensible i may\n",
      "be indebted to you, sir. for the rest, it is my refuge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“they say, those boastful english, that it is the refuge of many. you\n",
      "know a compatriot who has found a refuge there? a doctor?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“with a daughter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes,” said the marquis. “you are fatigued. good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "as he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy\n",
      "in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,\n",
      "which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. at the same\n",
      "time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin\n",
      "straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that\n",
      "looked handsomely diabolic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes,” repeated the marquis. “a doctor with a daughter. yes. so\n",
      "commences the new philosophy! you are fatigued. good night!”\n",
      "\n",
      "it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face\n",
      "outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. the nephew\n",
      "looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“good night!” said the uncle. “i look to the pleasure of seeing you\n",
      "again in the morning. good repose! light monsieur my nephew to his\n",
      "chamber there!--and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,” he\n",
      "added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his\n",
      "valet to his own bedroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "the valet come and gone, monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his\n",
      "loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still\n",
      "night. rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no\n",
      "noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some\n",
      "enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose\n",
      "periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just\n",
      "coming on.\n",
      "\n",
      "he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the\n",
      "scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow\n",
      "toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the\n",
      "prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at\n",
      "the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the\n",
      "chain under the carriage. that fountain suggested the paris fountain,\n",
      "the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the\n",
      "tall man with his arms up, crying, “dead!”\n",
      "\n",

      "the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that mr. lorry observed a great\n",
      "change to have come over the doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted\n",
      "there, had struck him a poisoned blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "he had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been\n",

      "\n",
      "two things at once impressed themselves on mr. lorry, as important above\n",
      "all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from lucie;\n",

      "conjunction with miss pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter\n",
      "precaution, by giving out that the doctor was not well, and required a\n",
      "few days of complete rest. in aid of the kind deception to be practised\n",
      "on his daughter, miss pross was to write, describing his having been\n",
      "called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of\n",
      "two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been\n",
      "addressed to her by the same post.\n",

      "this time, mr. lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer\n",
      "from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. in the\n",
      "meanwhile, the doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had\n",

      "\n",
      "with a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and\n",
      "heavier, mr. lorry passed through this anxious time. the secret was\n",
      "well kept, and lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to\n",
      "observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,\n",
      "was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on\n",
      "his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in\n",
      "the dusk of the ninth evening.\n",

      "\n",
      "worn out by anxious watching, mr. lorry fell asleep at his post. on the\n",
      "tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun\n",
      "into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "he rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had\n",
      "done so, whether he was not still asleep. for, going to the door of the\n",
      "doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s bench\n",
      "and tools were put aside again, and that the doctor himself sat reading\n",
      "at the window. he was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which\n",
      "mr. lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly\n",
      "studious and attentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, mr. lorry felt\n",
      "giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might\n",
      "not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his\n",
      "friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed\n",
      "as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of\n",
      "which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?\n",
      "\n",
      "it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the\n",
      "answer being obvious. if the impression were not produced by a real\n",
      "corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, jarvis lorry, there?\n",
      "how came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in doctor\n",
      "manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the\n",
      "doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "within a few minutes, miss pross stood whispering at his side. if he\n",
      "had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have\n",
      "resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.\n",
      "he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular\n",
      "breakfast-hour, and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual\n",
      "had occurred. if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, mr.\n",
      "lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from\n",
      "the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "miss pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked\n",
      "out with care. having abundance of time for his usual methodical\n",
      "toilette, mr. lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual\n",
      "white linen, and with his usual neat leg. the doctor was summoned in the\n",
      "usual way, and came to breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those\n",
      "delicate and gradual approaches which mr. lorry felt to be the only safe\n",
      "advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had taken\n",
      "place yesterday. an incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to\n",
      "the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and\n",
      "counting, and evidently made him uneasy. in all other respects, however,\n",
      "he was so composedly himself, that mr. lorry determined to have the aid\n",
      "he sought. and that aid was his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the\n",
      "doctor were left together, mr. lorry said, feelingly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“my dear manette, i am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a\n",
      "very curious case in which i am deeply interested; that is to say, it is\n",
      "very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less\n",
      "so.”\n",
      "\n",
      "glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the\n",
      "doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. he had already glanced\n",
      "at his hands more than once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“doctor manette,” said mr. lorry, touching him affectionately on the\n",
      "arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. pray\n",
      "give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,\n",
      "for his daughter’s--his daughter’s, my dear manette.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“if i understand,” said the doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental\n",

      "\n",
      "“yes!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“be explicit,” said the doctor. “spare no detail.”\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“my dear manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,\n",
      "of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,\n",
      "the--the--as you express it--the mind. the mind. it is the case of a\n",
      "shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how\n",
      "long, because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there\n",
      "are no other means of getting at it. it is the case of a shock from\n",
      "which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace\n",
      "himself--as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. it is\n",
      "the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to\n",
      "be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and\n",
      "great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his\n",
      "stock of knowledge, which was already very large. but, unfortunately,\n",
      "there has been,” he paused and took a deep breath--“a slight relapse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the doctor, in a low voice, asked, “of how long duration?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“nine days and nights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“how did it show itself? i infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in the\n",
      "resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that is the fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“now, did you ever see him,” asked the doctor, distinctly and\n",
      "collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit\n",
      "originally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all\n",

      "\n",
      "“i think in all respects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you spoke of his daughter. does his daughter know of the relapse?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no. it has been kept from her, and i hope will always be kept from her.\n",
      "it is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “that was very kind. that was\n",
      "very thoughtful!” mr. lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of\n",
      "the two spoke for a little while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“now, my dear manette,” said mr. lorry, at length, in his most\n",
      "considerate and most affectionate way, “i am a mere man of business,\n",
      "and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. i do not\n",
      "possess the kind of information necessary; i do not possess the kind of\n",
      "intelligence; i want guiding. there is no man in this world on whom\n",
      "i could so rely for right guidance, as on you. tell me, how does this\n",
      "relapse come about? is there danger of another? could a repetition of it\n",
      "be prevented? how should a repetition of it be treated? how does it come\n",
      "about at all? what can i do for my friend? no man ever can have been\n",
      "more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than i am to serve mine,\n",
      "if i knew how.\n",
      "\n",
      "“but i don’t know how to originate, in such a case. if your sagacity,\n",
      "knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, i might be\n",
      "able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, i can do so little.\n",
      "pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,\n",
      "and teach me how to be a little more useful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and\n",
      "mr. lorry did not press him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i think it probable,” said the doctor, breaking silence with an effort,\n",
      "“that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite\n",
      "unforeseen by its subject.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“was it dreaded by him?” mr. lorry ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "“very much.” he said it with an involuntary shudder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s\n",
      "mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force\n",
      "himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“would he,” asked mr. lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail\n",
      "upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on\n",
      "him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i think so. but it is, as i have told you, next to impossible. i even\n",
      "believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“now,” said mr. lorry, gently laying his hand on the doctor’s arm again,\n",
      "after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this\n",
      "attack?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i believe,” returned doctor manette, “that there had been a strong and\n",
      "extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that\n",
      "was the first cause of the malady. some intense associations of a most\n",
      "distressing nature were vividly recalled, i think. it is probable that\n",
      "there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations\n",
      "would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a\n",
      "particular occasion. he tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the\n",
      "effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked mr. lorry,\n",
      "with natural hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "the doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and\n",
      "answered, in a low voice, “not at all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“now, as to the future,” hinted mr. lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“as to the future,” said the doctor, recovering firmness, “i should have\n",
      "great hope. as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, i\n",
      "should have great hope. he, yielding under the pressure of a complicated\n",
      "something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,\n",

      "the worst was over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, well! that’s good comfort. i am thankful!” said mr. lorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i am thankful!” repeated the doctor, bending his head with reverence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there are two other points,” said mr. lorry, “on which i am anxious to\n",
      "be instructed. i may go on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you cannot do your friend a better service.” the doctor gave him his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“to the first, then. he is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;\n",
      "he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional\n",
      "knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. now, does\n",
      "he do too much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i think not. it may be the character of his mind, to be always in\n",
      "singular need of occupation. that may be, in part, natural to it; in\n",
      "part, the result of affliction. the less it was occupied with healthy\n",
      "things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy\n",
      "direction. he may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i think i am quite sure of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“my dear manette, if he were overworked now--”\n",
      "\n",
      "“my dear lorry, i doubt if that could easily be. there has been a\n",
      "violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“excuse me, as a persistent man of business. assuming for a moment,\n",
      "that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this\n",
      "disorder?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i do not think so. i do not think,” said doctor manette with the\n",
      "firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of\n",
      "association would renew it. i think that, henceforth, nothing but some\n",
      "extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. after what has\n",
      "happened, and after his recovery, i find it difficult to imagine any\n",
      "such violent sounding of that string again. i trust, and i almost\n",
      "believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”\n",

      "he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing\n",
      "would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the\n",
      "confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal\n",
      "endurance and distress. it was not for his friend to abate that\n",
      "confidence. he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he\n",
      "really was, and approached his second and last point. he felt it to\n",
      "be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old sunday morning\n",
      "conversation with miss pross, and remembering what he had seen in the\n",
      "last nine days, he knew that he must face it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction\n",
      "so happily recovered from,” said mr. lorry, clearing his throat, “we\n",

      "case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad\n",

      "“it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings\n",
      "of this poor man’s mind. he once yearned so frightfully for that\n",
      "occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved\n",
      "his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for\n",
      "the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more\n",

      "\n",
      "at first, his mind reverted to defarge, and he thought of finding out\n",

      "the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. but, the\n",
      "same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the\n",

      "its dangerous workings.\n",
      "\n",
      "noon coming, and the doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay\n",
      "tending to compromise tellson’s, mr. lorry advised with lucie. she said\n",
      "that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that\n",
      "quarter, near the banking-house. as there was no business objection to\n",
      "this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles, and\n",
      "he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, mr. lorry\n",
      "went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up\n",

      "considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.\n",
      "a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly\n",
      "and heavily the day lagged on with him.\n",

      "it wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the bank closed. he\n",
      "was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to\n",
      "do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. in a few moments, a\n",
      "man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,\n",

      "\n",

      "the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her\n",
